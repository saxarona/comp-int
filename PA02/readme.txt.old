Now that you know the rules, you can test the code by using Octave.

- Load the data from the csv file: data = load('dataset01.csv');
- Select the columns that contain the inputs: P = data(:, 1:2);
- Select the columns that contain the expected outputs: T = data(:, 3);

For the single-layer perceptron:
- Train the perceptron: [W, b] = train(P, T, 500, @hardlim);
- Test the perceptron: accuracy = test(W, b, P, T, @hardlim)

For the multilayer perceptron:
- Test the perceptron: accuracy = test2(W1, b1, W2, b2, P, T, @hardlim, @hardlim)
