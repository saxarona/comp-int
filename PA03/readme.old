Now that you know the rules, you can test the code by using Octave.

An example of classification:

- Load the data from the csv file: data = load('dataset-PA02.csv');
- Select the columns that contain the inputs: P = data(:, 1:2);
- Select the columns that contain the expected outputs: T = data(:, 3);
- Train the perceptron: [W1, b1, W2, b2] = train2(P, T, 2, 0.1, 500, "classification");
- Test the perceptron: accuracy = test2(W1, b1, W2, b2, P, T, "classification")

An example of classification:

- Load the data from the csv file: data = load('dataFunction01.csv');
- Select the columns that contain the inputs: P = data(:, 1);
- Select the columns that contain the expected outputs: T = data(:, 2);
- Train the perceptron: [W1, b1, W2, b2] = train2(P, T, 2, 0.1, 500, "regression");
- Test the perceptron: accuracy = test2(W1, b1, W2, b2, P, T, "regression")
