# Notes on Fuzzy Logic

Fuzzy logic is quite a fuzzy concept.
Nah, really, it is all about memebership functions.
Instead of using **True** or **False**, we got *somewhat True* or *somewhat False*.


According to **Weisstein-Fuzzy**:

> An extension of two-valued logic such that statements need not be true or false, but may have a degree of truth between 0 and 1

**AIMA** (Check page 571 in the PDF):

> *Fuzzy Control* has been successful but mostly because control like that is simple.
